# Wireless_Sensor_Network
This repository contains code to simulate various kinds of protocols over wireless sensor network to test network lifetime, energy throughput and network latency


# To Do:
-	Change network parameters
	-	standardise the network
		-	should not contain network hotspots
	-	number of nodes: 300-400
	-	network area: 500 x 500
	-	message/packet size = 200 bits (earlier 2000 bits)
	-	need to add latency and energy throughput as node property (add them as a method in class **Node**)
- In Conventional Multi hop, we need to have mulitple short paths precalculated for every node, might need to change the entire code.
- Change parameters to get desired results
